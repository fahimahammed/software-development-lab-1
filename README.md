# Software Development Lab - 1

This repository is made to practise or simulate git merge, git push and other git commands in real life. First a messy Java program was given. Each task has been completed in seperate branch and finally merged with main.


## Tasks : 

* Task#0<br>
Check the output wheather it matches with the output given here. If your output doesen't match, please correct your program.<br>
* Task#1<br>
Update code style for better consistency. <br>
* Task#2<br>
Application now terminates early if the number of arguments passed into it is wrong, fix it.<br>
* Task#3<br>
Makes improvements to variable names<br>
* Task#4<br>
Refactors duplicate file read and write logic into methods<br>
* Task#5.<br>
Replaces string literals with constants, storing those constants in a new class called Constants.java<br>
* Task#6.<br>
Remove Temporary variables<br>
* Task#7.<br>
Eliminates the ‘done’ control-flow variable. Adds better response for search operation.<br>
* Task#8.<br>
Simplifies the logic behind the count operation<br>
* Task#9.<br>
Adds handling for case when user enters invalid arguments<br>
* Task#10.<br>
Add more comments and makes more naming improvements. <br>

<br>

Your should create git branch for every step with the name of the step, work on that particular step, commit the code with appropriate commit message and finally merge your branch to the master. For better understanding, write the commit message same as the task on each steps. And check every  time you change something, you didn't break anything by going through Run #1 to Run #6 and it matches the commit message.
